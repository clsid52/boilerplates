# Usage

- To run a webframwork, use the following command

- cargo run --bin <framework>

# There are a few frameworks to make use of:

- actix
- poem
- rocket
- tide
- warp

# i.e.

- cargo run --bin tide

# This will spin up the web framework service, which is then able to be tested using the validator.

# To validate the framework, in a new window type:

-cargo run --bin validator
